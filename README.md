- 👋 Hi, I’m @SaimMS.
- 👀 I’m interested in having control over tech, be it hardware or software.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning All Things Javascript, looking to get into Godot and Blender soon.
- 🧠 Interested in FOSS, but I'm fairly new to the community. Started with Ubuntu, willing to explore more.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on game ideas with people who are just as new to the field as I am.
